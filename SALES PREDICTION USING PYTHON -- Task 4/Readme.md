# Sales Prediction Using Python

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of different advertisement platforms (**TV, Radio, Newspaper**) on sales and build a predictive model for estimating future sales based on advertising investments.

## Objectives
- ðŸ“Œ Identify which advertising platform has the **strongest impact** on sales.
- ðŸ“Œ Develop a predictive model for sales based on advertisement spending.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset consists of information on advertising expenditures and their influence on **sales figures**.
- Features in the dataset:
  - ðŸ“Š **TV**: Advertising cost spent on TV.
  - ðŸ“» **Radio**: Advertising cost spent on Radio.
  - ðŸ“° **Newspaper**: Advertising cost spent on Newspaper.
  - ðŸ’° **Sales**: The dependent variable representing total sales.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- âœ… Checked for **missing values** and **data types**; no null or duplicate entries were found.
- âœ… Performed **univariate analysis** to understand feature distributions.
- âœ… Identified and treated **outliers** in the dataset.
- âœ… Created a **correlation heatmap** to examine relationships between features:
  - ðŸ“ˆ **TV has a strong positive correlation (~0.90) with Sales.**
  - ðŸ“Š **Radio has a moderate correlation (~0.41) with Sales.**
  - ðŸ“° **Newspaper has a weak correlation (~0.15) with Sales.**
- âœ… The absence of **collinearity** among features indicates that each platform contributes independently to sales.

## Model Building
- ðŸ”¹ Split the data into **training and test sets**.
- ðŸ”¹ Trained a **Linear Regression Model** to predict sales.
- ðŸ”¹ Evaluated model performance using:
  - ðŸ“Œ **R-squared (RÂ²) score**
  - ðŸ“Œ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

## Findings
- âœ… **TV advertising has the most significant impact** on sales.
- âœ… The **linear regression model achieves a reasonable level of accuracy**.
- âœ… **Newspaper advertising has minimal impact on sales.**

## Key Insights
- ðŸ“¢ Investing in **TV advertisements** results in **higher sales growth**.
- ðŸ“» **Radio contributes to sales**, but its impact is **moderate compared to TV**.
- ðŸ“° **Newspaper ads show little to no significant effect** on sales performance.
